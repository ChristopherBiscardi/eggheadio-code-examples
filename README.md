# Playlists

Here are playlists on specific topics that I add to over time. Each
has an RSS feed that can be subscribed to.

## Go from Scratch

[Go from Scratch](https://egghead.io/playlists/golang-from-scratch-3c9d58fa)

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build
simple, reliable, and efficient software. It is used frequently in the
container ecosystem by projects such as Kubernetes (container
orchestration), Docker (containers), and Cilium (BPF networking).

This playlist is a collection of videos that will start you off on
your Golang journey.

## Using Emotion with Gatsby

[Using Emotion with
Gatsby](https://egghead.io/playlists/using-emotion-with-gatsby-c167ea3d)

Emotion and Gatsby let you build static websites and dynamic
applications while sharing composable styles.

Emotion is a library designed for writing css styles with
JavaScript. It provides powerful and predictable style composition in
addition to a great developer experience with features such as source
maps, labels, and testing utilities.

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps
developers build blazing fast websites and apps
